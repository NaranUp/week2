## Alpha and Digital Color

### Alpha

To store matte information, the concept of an alpha channel was introduced by Alvy Ray Smith in the late 1970s and fully developed in a 1984 paper by Thomas Porter and Tom Duff.

In computer graphics, alpha compositing is the process of combining one image with a background to create the appearance of partial or full transparency.
Alpha blending is also used in 2D computer graphics to put rasterized foreground elements over a background.

In a 2D picture element (pixel), which stores a color for each pixel, additional data is stored in the alpha channel with a value ranging from 0 to 1

### Color Model

HSL
> Hue 색상    
> Saturation 채도    
> Value 명도    

RGB
> 가산혼합

CMYK
> 감산혼합 

CIE Lab
> lightness     
> a”red-green”    
> b”yellow-blue”    

### bit
The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit.    
When referring to a pixel, the concept can be defined as bits per pixel.
When referring to a color component, the concept can be defined as bits per component, bits per channel, bits per color (all three abbreviated bpc), and also bits per pixel component, bits per color channel or bits per sample (bps)

>2bit=2의 2제곱=4 colors    
>4bit=2의 4제곱=16 colors    
>8bit=2의 8제곱=256(0~255)colors     
>16bit=2의 16제곱=65536 colors    
>32bit=2의 32제곱= 1677216 colors

### Data type

+ Vector (0,0,0)
+ Integer (0) 정수값
+ Float (0.123)
+ Boolean (1,0) =(on/off)
+ String 모든값 입력가능 (숫자가 아니라 글자로 인식)
>	Int(3)+int(5)=int(8)    
> Str(3)=Str(5)=Str(35) 
+ ect
